# home 

My name is Jan Frederik Hake.
I am a software developer from Paderborn / Germany.
This is my view of how **software development craftsmanship** should be.

As this is **a living document**, it will grow and shrink with time. 

# projects

Let's start with the result first. 
This is a list of software, which you can actually run either online, or on your machine. 

## retro

When the Covid19 pandemy started, we went to homeoffice. 
As I am working for a small company, there was no huge step to work from home. 
The vpn was in place before, and it has been working quite well.

When it comes to the scrum process, we tried different solutions for our retrospective. 
All of them required a kind of login and had a lot of feature, where we needed only a fraction of this. 
So I give it a try and try to [build something for my own][1].

It was quiet a lot of fun, and I have a new playground for **angular** and **elixir**.
There is **no need for a personalized login**.
Every retro session is only kept within memory.

## Memory UI

How are thoughts linked?

I first started with the [brain project][5]. 
I placed every memory within a markdown file.
Every file contains a header with metadata and some text.
Every memory can have a link to an other memory.
All memories and all links represents a knowlede graph, presented by an [adjacency list][6].
I collected some [memories][7] over time.

To get a first impression for usefullness, I created a [static client][8].

You can [play around][9] if you like.
