# vim airline

When you have many open buffers, it is helpful,
to have some information about the current open file.

<!--more-->

[vim-airline][1] displays some basic infomation at the bottom of the buffer.

It also works well together with **fugitive**, **ctrlp** and **nerdtree** without any configuration.

## installation

```
Plug 'bling/vim-airline'
```
