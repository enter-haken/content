# color scheme

I use two color themes. 
One for my daily work, and one as a fallback.

As a main theme, I use the [Nord Theme][1].
I try to apply this theme system wide, so I use it also with vim.

There is a [git repo][2] for the plugin, comming from [Arctic Ice Studio][3].

It contains a [nord.vim][4] file, which contains some color definitions.

```
Plug 'arcticicestudio/nord-vim'
```
As a fallback I use [jellybeans][5]

This theme works even well with an non 256 color terminal.

```
Plug 'nanotech/jellybeans.vim'
```
