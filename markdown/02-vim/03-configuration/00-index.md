# configuration

Even for a small configuration, it makes sense to split up your configuration in **multiple files**.
There are configuration settings **for vim itself**, configs for plugins and so on.
You can setup vim **almost everything what you like**.

At the end we'll take a look at the changes. It is important, that **you can understand your config**, and that **you can live with your config**. 
Many thinks in vim **work out of the box**.

Like gardening, you have to take care from time to time.

# tl;dr

You can find my current NeoVim configuration [here][1]
