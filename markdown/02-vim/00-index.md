# vim

When my dev universe would have a center, it would be **vim**.

When I started developing software, I used Visual Studio for writing C# code, 
and Eclipse for Java.
I thought, no one is writing code with a simple editor.

Visual Studio is a mighty tool, with a lot of features, 
which helps you getting speed up your development skills.
It was completely ok at this time.
When you are working with languages, using a kind of project files like a `*.csproj` or `*.sln`, IDEs are very helpfull.
Goto definition, find references, refactor files and many other features I've used for years.

But you also get thinks like **vendor lock in** and **black magic**.

Moving **away from .net and the JVM** make things easier.
Other langages/frameworks like elixir, erlang, python, haskell, 
typescript, react or angular are **less IDE agnostic**.

So the question is: **How does a editor based dev environment look like?**
